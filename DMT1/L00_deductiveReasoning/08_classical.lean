# Classical vs Constructive Disjunction

## Classical

In classical logic and ordinary intuition for
many people, *especially* for programmers who
have grown up on the *Boolean* abstraction, it
is self-evident that any factual statment (any
proposition) is either true or false. If it's
one, it's not the other, and it has to be one
of the two.

In this logic, if one is given proposition, *P*,
of unknown truth/validity, there are just two
cases one ever has to consider: one where *P* is
true, one where *P* is false. For example, when
we program, we need code for only *two* branches
of an *(if)* statement. There are just two cases
for which you need code to get to good endings.

In classical logic, given a proposition, P,
it's *axiomatic* that *P = true ∨ P = false*
is true. To be mathematically more precise,
we'll introduce the notation, *⟦P⟧*, to mean
*the value of P*. Now we can properly state
the point: *it's an axiom of classical logic*
that *⟦P⟧ = true ∨ ⟦P⟧ = false*. (Again, use
the words *the value of* to pronounce ⟦·⟧,
now return and read it outloud to yourself.)

### Constructive

Is this axiom of *classical* logic an axiom
we've met so far in constructive logic? No,
it's not. It's not among the introduction or
elimination rules for any of the connectives
we've seen so far; and the only one we have
left is the existential, *∃ (a : α), P a*.
So, no, it's not an axiom in this logic.

Is it a theorem? From our constructive axioms
we've been able to prove numerous important
and interesting theorems, including, e.g., that
*And* (∧) and *Or* (∨) are both *commutative*
and *associative*. It seems reasonable to try
to prove *{P : Prop} : P ∨ ¬P* similarly. Ok
so let's try.

Let *P* be any proposition.

axiom P : Prop

Now prove P ∨ ¬P.

/- @@@
Given only this assumption, can we prove
*P ∨ ¬P*? The rub is in the difference between
accepting *P ∨ ¬P* as an *axiom* (always true),
or insisting on evidence one way or the other
to justify the conclusion that one or the other
is actually in-real-life true. The problem then
is that to get a proof of *P ∨ ¬P* you have to
have either a proof of *P* or a proof of *¬P*
from which to build a proof of *P ∨ ¬P*, and
no one's handing out free proofs of arbitrary
propositions, or of their negations.
Ok but let's at least see how far we can get.

At this point we have to choose Or.inl or
Or.inr. Or.inl requires a proof of P, but
we don't have one. Or.inr requires a proof
of Q but we don't have one. Let's go left
one more step. Then that's it. Stuck!

  (
    -- P is some Prop. We have no proof of it.
    -- That's the end of the line; quit
    _

### The Law (Axiom) of the Excluded Middle

A crucial property of classical logic is that
given any proposition, is either truth or false.
There is no muddled middling state. But in the
constructive logic of Lean, if you don't have
either have a proof that *P* is true or a proof
that *¬P* is true, then you do not know that
*P ∨ ¬P* is. This is a muddled middle state
of unknown truth value in constructive logic.

It's also the state dispensed with by the *law
of the excluded middle*. That phrasing makes it
sound like something imposed by an authority,
but it's really just an axiom you can include
in your logic or not.

Lean provides such an axiom in the Classical
namespace. If you *open* that you'll have
direct access to *Classical.em*, stipulating
*∀ (P : Prop), P ∨ ¬P* as an axiom.

In terms of constructive logic reasoning the
way to think about this is that if all you
know is that *P* is some proposition, and
you really need to finish your proof with a
case analysis with *P* true (and a proof of
it) in one case, and *¬P* true in the other
case (with a proof of it), then what you do
is apply *em* to *P* to get a *free* proof
of *P ∨ ¬P*. You then do a case analysis on
the result. The code pattern will usually
look like this:

match (Classical.em P) with
|  p => _    -- in this case p proves P
| np => _    -- in this case np proves ¬P

If you  want classical reasoning, just
use *Classical.em*. If you *open* the
*Classical* namespace, you can just write
*em P*.

#check Classical.em P
-- a proof of P ∨ ¬P for free!

## Why Reject Some Axioms

There are innumerable variant logics that
mix  and match a variety of such axioms. Adding
axioms usually enlarges the set of propositions
that can be proved as theorems.

So why would anyone want fewer propositions to
be provable as theorems? Well, if from the axioms
you can prove really weird ____ (RWS), then you
might want to reject as self-evident the axioms
that enabled such terrible logical creatures to
emerge, by deduction!, from self-evident truths.

For example ...

we interrupt for a special announcement. Prof.
Sullivan did not have time to type the following
himself, so he let his humanoid robot do it for
him. Just remember that as in photography real
greatness is in the selection of just exactly
what to shoot (photographically, of course).

So here you go.

First, I pointed my camera with this prompt:
What's a great example of a weird or monstrous
theorem in mathematics enabled by acceptance
of certain non-constructive axioms?

You see. If you had not been patient enough
to sit in my class, you'd have no conceivable
path to posing just that question. But now
you do. So, you can practice using your new
capability to take much more interesting
shots than you ever would have before. Here
what then skittered across my screen.

This material has been state hundreds if not
thousands of times in the digital record, or
more. Than you to the many original sources.

Robotic response. It's plenty good enough!
Quote:

The Banach-Tarski Paradox is perhaps the
most gloriously monstrous example!

The Statement: You can take a solid 3D ball, decompose it into finitely many pieces (typically 5), and reassemble those pieces using only rotations and translations into two solid balls, each the same size as the original.

This seems to violate conservation of volume in the most egregious way possible—you're literally doubling matter through pure rearrangement!

The Non-Constructive Culprit: This result fundamentally relies on the Axiom of Choice (AC), particularly in constructing the bizarre decomposition. The pieces involved are non-measurable sets—they're so pathological that you can't assign them a meaningful volume. The proof uses AC to:

    Create a dense, paradoxical subset of the sphere's surface
    Build these unmeasurable pieces that can be rotated and rearranged in contradictory ways

Why It's Monstrous:

    The pieces have no volume in any meaningful sense
    You cannot actually describe or construct these pieces explicitly
    It's purely an existence proof—AC guarantees such decompositions exist, but provides no algorithm to find them
    It completely breaks our physical intuitions about matter and space

The Constructivist Objection: Mathematicians who reject AC (like constructivists and some intuitionists) don't accept this paradox. Without AC, you can actually prove that such "paradoxical decompositions" are impossible for measurable sets. They'd argue: "If you can't construct these pieces explicitly, why should we believe they exist?"

This is the perfect example of non-constructive mathematics producing something that feels more like a mathematical horror story than a theorem!

## The "Hard" DeMorgan Law: ¬(P ∧ Q) vs (¬P ∨ ¬Q) @@@

One direction is constructively valid. The other direction
is not. In constructive predicate logic¬(P ∧ Q) → (¬P ∨ ¬Q)
is not a theorem. We cannot deduce its truth from the axioms
of logic we've been assuming nearly all semester.

## Why It Fails Constructively

-- To prove ¬(P ∧ Q) → (¬P ∨ ¬Q) constructively, we would need
-- to decide which disjunct holds. But from ¬(P ∧ Q) alone,
-- we only know that P and Q can't both be true simultaneously.
-- We don't have enough information to determine whether:
--   - P is false (left disjunct), or
--   - Q is false (right disjunct), or
--   - both are false

-- This is fundamentally a non-constructive step requiring
-- the law of excluded middle.
