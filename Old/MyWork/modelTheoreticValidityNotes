AKA model-theoretic validity. Depends on there
always beinga finte number of possible worlds in
which a proposition ever needs to be evaluated to
determine whether or not its true in *all* possible
worlds.

This nice property arises from the choice of Boolean
algebra as the fixed semantic domain for expressions
in propositional logic. Well, what if we wanted the
variables in a logical expression to refer not only
to Boolean truth values, as it were, but to be able
to refer to objects of any kind imaginable.

That is what we get, over propositional logic, when
we meet predicate logic. To evaluate an expression
one must specify a both the semantic domain itself,
which is to say a space of all possible worlds,
and and an interpretation specifying the meanings
of the variables in an expression in that selected
domain.

Well, now we have an infinite collection of semantic
domains, with finite or inifite numbers of individual 
worlds in them. What we want to know with Clearly checking whether an expression
is true in a finite a finite number of


the number of possible worlds that one
